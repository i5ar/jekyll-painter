# Jekyll Painter

A [Jekyll][jekyllrb] theme for creating [Reveal.js][reveal.js] presentation along with [Lazy Line Painter][lazy-line-painter] animations.

## TODO

- Add languages modal `Â£` key;
- Add custom modal `!` key;
- Replace help `?` modal keys;
- Customize arrows and styles with *fontawesome*;
- Add modal template to `_layouts`;
- Short `_includes` file names.
- Use `head.js` library to prevent `Uncaught TypeError`;
- Use `class` with in `id` or `data-line` to load animation consecutively.
